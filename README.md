##📘 Fix the Docs: Smarter, Faster, Maintainable Documentation

#🌍 Context
In real-world tech environments, documentation is broken:
- Writing is slow, repetitive, and often skipped.
- Reading is painful, especially for new joiners.
- Maintaining docs is impractical — they quickly become outdated or misleading.
This leads to onboarding delays, wasted engineering time, and avoidable bugs.
Introducing Saga - a smart documentation assistant that makes documentation smarter, faster, and always maintainable.

#🚀 The Challenge
Our mission is to design and build a tool that improves how documentation is created, consumed, and maintained in fast-changing software environments.
We focus on:
- Simplifying Writing
- Auto-generate starter docs from code, git commits, or comments
- Templates & AI-powered writing suggestions
- Real-time assistants & Markdown validators

Speeding Up Reading
- Summarization tools (TL;DR for long docs)
- Smart Q&A search (ChatGPT for your docs)
- Visualizations (API call flows, dependency graphs, changelogs)
