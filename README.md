# Fix the Docs: Smarter, Faster, Maintainable Documentation for the Real World by iFAST  
CodeNection Track 3 

## üåç Context  
In real-world tech environments, **documentation is broken**:  
- Writing is slow, repetitive, and often skipped.  
- Reading is painful, especially for new joiners.  

This leads to onboarding delays, wasted engineering time, and avoidable bugs.  

**Saga** is a smart documentation assistant that makes documentation **smarter, faster, and always maintainable**.  


## üöÄ The Challenge  
Our mission is to design and build a tool that improves how documentation is **created, consumed, and maintained** in fast-changing software environments.  

We focus on:  
1. **Simplifying Writing**  
   - Auto-generate starter docs from code, git commits, or comments  
   - Templates & AI-powered writing suggestions  
   - Real-time assistants & Markdown validators  

2. **Speeding Up Reading**  
   - Summarization tools (*TL;DR for long docs*)  
   - Smart Q&A search (ChatGPT for your docs)  
   - Visualizations (API call flows, dependency graphs, changelogs)  

## üõ†Ô∏è Components & Pages to Build  

### **1. Write - Create and Edit Docs**  
- Template library (README, API docs, onboarding)  
- AI-powered editor like Grammarly, but for tech
- Markdown Validator ‚Üí live preview + validation checks  

### **2. Auto Generate - AI-powered generation**  
- Generate/edit docs directly from repo, code, or commits  
- Outputs starter docs in multiple formats

### **3. Read & Search - Smart Q&A and Search**  
- Unified search assistant across docs + repo
- TL;DR summaries for long documents 

### **4. Visualize - Charts and Diagrams**  
- Auto-generated diagrams:  
  - API call flows  
  - Dependency graphs  
  - Changelog timelines
